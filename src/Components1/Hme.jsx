            <h1>They need a family too.</h1><br />
        <h3>A roof over their heads is a critical need of the elder who are destitute, sick and abandoned by family and those uprooted by disasters. ApnaPan India has established model homes for the senior citizens and aged in places such as Patiala & Gurdaspur in Punjab, Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu and Kolkata in West Bengal. ApnaPan supports 300 old age homes and runs 5 barrier homes for the aged in India.</h3><br />
        <p>ApnaPan is able to carry out its work on the ground due to the generosity of its donors. Its largest supporters are individuals who donate to the elder cause from their hard-earned money. Among them are also school children who want to make a difference and are motivated by teachers and parents to do their bit for the elderly. On the other hand, Corporate Social Responsibility has increased over the years, with more and more companies now choosing to do their bit for society. Companies donate in various ways – the foremost being supporting our projects on the ground, such as donating and supporting the running costs of our Mobile Healthcare Units, sponsoring cataract surgeries, and our Support a Gran program, among others. Other ways of support are through Cause Related Marketing and Payroll Giving initiatives, even donating in kind.

ApnaPan also receives wide support from various Trusts & Foundations across the country.</p>

<h1>Get the Right Care and Attention at the Right Time</h1> <br />
    <p>Craving to establish ourselves as an NGO for Old Age Homes/senior citizens in India, Hindrise Social Welfare Foundation is endeavoring to uplift the socio-economic status of abandoned and neglected senior citizens residing in various parts of India. We are moving ahead with the belief that our efforts would help them live a noble and respectable life.

We have done the ground-level research, and we have identified the requirements of older adults suffering due to the complications concerning changes in the environment and life-related challenges. In the last few years, the concept concerning nuclear families has overshadowed the joint family concept. This thing has given birth to differences in the families on various matters that eventually disturb the peace of mind of elderly individuals. A vital proportion of the senior citizens living in the country are facing hardships in spending their remaining life in a peaceful way.</p>
